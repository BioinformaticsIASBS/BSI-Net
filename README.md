# BSI-Net: Biotech-Small molecule Interaction Prediction Network
## Overview
A deep learning-based framework for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) using graph attention networks (GAT). The project integrates small molecule and biotech drug data to build an end-to-end DDI prediction pipeline.

### Requirements
requirements.txt - Lists all necessary dependencies to ensure a smooth setup and execution of the project.

### The repository consists of two main directories:
### 1. Data
Contains various datasets, matrices, and embeddings used in the model.
### 2. Code
Includes multiple Jupyter notebooks implementing different models.
1. Main.ipynb: The notebook for running the pipeline.
2. CNN.ipynb - Implements a convolutional neural network for DDI prediction.
3. MLP.ipynb - Implements a multi-layer perceptron model.
4. RF_XGB_SVM.ipynb - Implements traditional machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM).
